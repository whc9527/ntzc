NTZC (Network Tree Zero Copy) Version 0.6

Something about Network Tree Zero Copy

Network Tree Zero Copy (ntzc) is a set of tools to support copyless user space (receive and tranmit) network packet access, which includes a kernel module, network buffer kernel library and user mode routines.

NTZC doesn't depend on specific NIC drivers, normal standard NIC drivers can be easily modified using ntzc network buffer APIs to replace sk_buff APIs, which makes user mode applications to access the NIC with zero copy requirement in all the path from NIC DMA to user space ability.

A pcnet32 driver being included to demonstrate how easy to modify the code.

NTZC is inspired by Evgeniy Polyakov's nta and forked from the code, but with extensive simplify, enhancement, debug and test.
